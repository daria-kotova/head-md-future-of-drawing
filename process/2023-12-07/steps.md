# All the Steps to Build Snailed-it

## Form
- 3D Modelling (Fusion 360)
    - Base with space for electronics
    - Leg + fixations for the projector
    - Head
   
## Materials

- Wood (for first prototype to check if the dimensions are ok)
    - Talk to people at Wood Pool 

- Metal (for base, leg and fixations)
    - Talk to people at Metal Pool

- 3D printing (for head, buttons??)

- Something to cover projector and Raspberry Pi power cables (cloth thingy with velcro?)

- Paint

## Electronics

- Raspberry Pi
    - Code
        - Install Linux
        - Detection of RFID tags
        - Get an image based on the tag and chosen parameters
        - Teach AI to recognize objects with a camera (in a perfect world)
    - Input
        - 3 buttons
        - Potentiometer
        - NFC tags and RFID reader
        - camera (in a perfect world)
    - Output
        - projector (BeamBuddy for now, Pico projector in a perfect world)
        
- Wiring
- Power
    - Projector power cable
    - Raspberry Pi power cable
- API (in a perfect world)

## Others

- Choose 5 objects
- Prepare a pool of output images
- Learn AI image recognition
