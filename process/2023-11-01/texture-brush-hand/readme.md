# Texture-to-brush hand

## Description

![texture-to-brush-hand-1](/process/2023-11-01/texture-brush-hand/IMG_5010.jpg) This device is used to turn any texture into a brush. It consists of two hands. The first one detacts textures that you give to it and then transfers information about them to the second hand. The second hand can be put on your own hand and be used to draw with a "brush" created from your texture.
