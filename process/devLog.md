This is a file with my day-to-day progress.

## 2023-11-01

Continued doing [texture](/process/2023-11-01/textures-new-tests) and [sound](/process/2023-11-01/sound-tests) tests. Decided not to persue with [tastes](/process/2023-11-01/taste-tests) and sounds.

Made two prototypes: [texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand) ![texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand/IMG_5010.jpg) and [texture-to-image convertor](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-image-convertor).

Need to think on how to add the mystery/exploration aspect to the assistant.
