**Pitch (what, who, where, and how)**

Kick-starter is an assistant that helps people start drawing using the outlines of small objects around them. It is designed for people looking to occupy their free time. These people are open to drawing but do not know where or how to start. Kick-starter can be used at home, in the office or even at school. Simply place it on a sheet of paper and choose a small object to use as the basis for your future drawing. After analysing your object, Kick-starter draws its outline, which you can then use to kick-start your drawing.


**User journey**

**Key insights**
1. There is existential boredom, when people have suddenly a lot of free time and they are looking for ways to occupy themselves.
2. A lot of people do not mind drawing but they do not know what to draw and how to start.
3. Some people would like to draw in a collaboration as it can be more fun.

Made a paper prototype of [Kick-starter](/process/2023-11-11/kick-starter) - an assistant that allows you to draw the outlines of small objects and thus start a drawing.

Prototype idea: the assistant detects if you put something on the paper, it then immediately rushes to the object and starts drawing around it. Drawing with negative space.

Why do I focus on textures? My assistant could help to draw whatever you want. You put something inside it, choose what outcome you want (complexity) and it scans the object and then draws it based on your settings. Thus it invites you to explore the world around you and helps you to overcome the initial creative block ("I do not mind drawing but I do not know what to draw and how").

It can say: "Show me the world and I will show you how to draw it", "I want to learn more!.

Continued doing [texture](/process/2023-11-01/textures-new-tests) and [sound](/process/2023-11-01/sound-tests) tests. Decided not to persue with [tastes](/process/2023-11-01/taste-tests) and sounds.

Made two prototypes: [texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand) ![texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand/IMG_5010.jpg) and [texture-to-image convertor](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-image-convertor).

Need to think on how to add the mystery/exploration aspect to the assistant.
