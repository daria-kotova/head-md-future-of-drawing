Prototype idea: the assistant detects if you put something on the paper, it then immediately rushes to the object and starts drawing around it. Drawing with negative space.

Why do I focus on textures? My assistant could help to draw whatever you want. You put something inside it, choose what outcome you want (complexity) and it scans the object and then draws it based on your settings. Thus it invites you to explore the world around you and helps you to overcome the initial creative block ("I do not mind drawing but I do not know what to draw and how").

It can say: "Show me the world and I will show you how to draw it", "I want to learn more!.

Continued doing [texture](/process/2023-11-01/textures-new-tests) and [sound](/process/2023-11-01/sound-tests) tests. Decided not to persue with [tastes](/process/2023-11-01/taste-tests) and sounds.

Made two prototypes: [texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand) ![texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand/IMG_5010.jpg) and [texture-to-image convertor](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-image-convertor).

Need to think on how to add the mystery/exploration aspect to the assistant.
