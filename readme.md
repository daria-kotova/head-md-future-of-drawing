This is my project with Caran d'Ache on the future of drawing, where we have to make a playful AI creative assistant. 

Current name of my assistant is Snailed-it.

Below is the devlog with my day-to-day progress. Enjoy.

![exp](/process/2024-01-17/IMG_6324.JPG)

Murphy's law continues to work, the code that worked last night and this morning did not work during my demo. Had to show images on my iPad, again. Quite dissapointed with this, but at least I know it works and I am satisfied with thes final form. Achievemebt unlocked. Product designed.

## 2024-01-16

Spent 6,5 hours figuring out my [code](/electronics/code/) with Vitas. And it worked! For now only two buttons are functional (outline and shading) and the image does not disappear when you remove an NFC tag. But still. Happy. 

However, I had not expected it to take sooo much time. So when I came back to the main building to get all my stuff, it was already locked. Had a mini panick attack. But crisis was averted, Lauren saved me.

Painted my parts in white at home. ![paint](/process/2024-01-16/3FE33738-2F6E-4EF5-B2AD-DD708CD67531.JPG)

## 2024-01-15

After some struggling with Processing I decided to code in Python, even though I had never done it before.

Tutorial for setting up RFID RC522 https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-rfid-rc522/ 

Stayed up till 1am and managed to write  scripts for reading NFC tags and displaying a related image, as well as ditacting the state of buttons. Chat GPT is trully useless in some cases, it just repeats itself and does not fix my issues.

Prepared my final [pdf](/presentations/240117_HEAD-MD1_Caran-d-Ache_Daria-Kotova-Snailed-it.pdf).

## 2024-01-14

Spent half of the day looking for a micro HDMI cable in the shops around home. It was quite a challenge, taking that it is Sunday. 

Prepared my Fritzing schematic ![schematic](/electronics/breadboard-with-projector.jpg) ![shematic-1](/electronics/schematic.jpg)

Well.. Cellotape does not really secure the SD card slot in place, the Pi keeps crushing. Will have to get another Pi from school.

## 2024-01-13

Went to school to get my 3D base for electronics ![base](/process/2024-01-13/IMG_6259.JPG) Spent 2-3 hours cleaning it from all the supports, only to find out that I had made a mistake in modelling. Even two. I forgot to consider how I am going to put the strip board with buttons inside. Also, need some extra space for cables. Had to fix it with a drill. ![fix](/process/2024-01-13/IMG_6264.JPG) But now everything seems to fit inside ![fix](/process/2024-01-13/IMG_6267.JPG)

I somehow managed to broke the slot for SD card on my raspberry pi... ![slot](/process/2024-01-13/IMG_6262.JPG)

Wanted to focus on my code, buuut... I left my micro HDMI cable at school..

## 2024-01-12

Got my two big 3D printed top parts and some parts for fixations. ![parts](/process/2024-01-12/IMG_6211.JPG) ![parts3](/process/2024-01-12/IMG_6235.JPG) ![parts3](/process/2024-01-12/IMG_6236.JPG) They took 11 and 14 hours to print. The 3D base is going to take 18 hours to print lol. The 3D printing industry needs to work more on their speed :/

The technique for connecting parts, that Fred told me about, when you make holes in both parts and then print connecting sticks separately, did not work. I completely mismatched the measurings, had to reprint the sticks twice myself

Soldered my buttons. I think I am getting a hang of it. ![solder2](/process/2024-01-12/IMG_6233.JPG) ![solder2](/process/2024-01-12/IMG_6234.JPG)

Overall, the object is starting to take its from ![form](/process/2024-01-12/IMG_6238.JPG)

My Bible for the next several days ![scheme](/electronics/GPIO-Pinout-Diagram-2.png)

## 2024-01-11

Got laser and zonde (?) cuts. Finally finished my battles with the 3D base. 

## 2024-01-10

Figuring out the electronics and 3D base. Prepared documents for laser cutting (fixation disks, plate, diffusor).

## 2024-01-09

Went to metal workshop. We managed to finish in 3 hours. When I say we, I mean Xavier, I was just giving instructions and following him everywhere lol. Satisfied with the result. ![metal](/process/2024-01-09/IMG_6136.JPG) However, at the end we realized that the tubes are to narrow and the projector power cable does not pass. Will have to cut it and get a new prise that can be opened. Ooops.s

## 2024-01-08

Trying to finalize my 3D model, because tomorrow I will go to the metal workshop. Still struggling a lot with the 3D base, because I failt to imagibe how everything will be positioned.

## 2024-01-10

Finally figured out my electronics situation. Gonna solder buttons. ![solder](/process/2024-01-10/IMG_6150.JPG)

## 2024-01-04

Chose 5 more input objects (to be limited to 4). Unfortunately no snail :( Ideally, I would have modelled them myself, but seems like a waste of time with my current level of 3D modelling.

- sheep https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:182273/files
- plane https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:182252/files
- penguin https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:182246/files
- bear https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:182072/files
- frog https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18479/files





## 2023-12-23

Jasmine got me a 3D printed boat as another input object for my project. ![boat](/process/2023-12-23/IMG_5918.JPG) Now I am thinking that I should 3D print all of my input objects, so that they are all in one style. Deffinitely one of the objects will be a snail (DAH).

## 2023-12-21

Improved shape of the shell. ![shell_0](/form/23-12-21/Screenshot%202023-12-21%20at%2009.15.50.png) ![shell](/form/23-12-21/Screenshot%202023-12-21%20at%2009.16.02.png) Now that I have the base of my model, we were able to discuss with Laure how I can fix my parts together. There will be a sort of a clamp to attach the shell to the leg ![clamp](/process/2023-12-21/IMG_5889.JPG) The shell itself will be printed in two parts and fixed from the inside. We also discussed how I should model the buttons ![buttons](/process/2023-12-21/IMG_5888.JPG)

TO REMEMBER:
- make holes for cables in the leg and in the base
- model the plate with holes that will be attached to the shell
- model buttons
- model base for electronics that will be 3D printed
- hole for camera?
- test other shapes of the shell
- invert tubes of the leg

Made an appointment at atelier de métal (Jan 9 and Jan 10 14:00-17:00). Also, just in case, booked an appointment with Chloe from pool numérique for 3D printing. But ideally would prefer print at atelier de prototypage, since they have bigger machines and a larger selection of materials.

## 2023-12-20

Finally figured out how to model a project and a shell around it. ![model](/form/23-12-20/Screenshot%202023-12-20%20at%2009.31.41.png)

The "random" button can be in a swirl form, to make reference to the name of the object.

## 2023-12-18

Went to atelier de bois in the morning. My giant baby ![baby](/process/2023-12-18/IMG_5847.JPG)

## 2023-12-17

Prepared mesurements to check at atelier de bois tomorrow. Still struggling with modelling the projector :/ ![3d](/process/2023-12-17/Image%2017-12-2023%20at%2022.28.JPG)

## 2023-12-14

Test day results

![test-day](/process/2023-12-14/IMG_5798.JPG)

1. It is still not very obvious that you need to take an object and put it on my device. In most cases I had to tell people that the snail was a part of the experience. In the second session, I tried putting it in a box right next to the device. Still unclear. Probably, having a group of objects will make things clearer. In addition, I need to try putting objects on some kind of a platform made of the same material as the square for positioning objects on the device.

2. The device is perceived as a lamp. Still need to think if that is the impression I want.

3. Blank buttons were not clear at all. Only one tester was curious enough to explore them without any explanation. Buttons with icons made more sense. Even though the icons were not always very understandable, they at least sparked some interest. Buttons with text are probably too in the face, but at the same time still not super clear. Will probably keep buttons with icons, but will reconsider the icons.

4. An interesting insight is that the first three buttons (outline, shapes, shading) are associated together. Some people saw them as different layers of one image. Meanwhile, the random button is a very fun option, but is a bit apart. So, the idea now is to group the three first buttons together and distinguish "random" from them (by color or shape and distance, like a golden button with a dimond on top, and encourages people to press it first). Also, need to switch positions of "outline" and "shapes" because it is more logical the other way round if we consider the drawing process (shapes -> outline -> shading).

5. When clicking on the random button again, people expect a new random image.

6. What if you put two objects? Does the assistant mix them?

7. "Shading" -> "volume"? "details"?

For the head part can use plastic instead of 3D printing.

Agreed with the guy from atelier de bois that I would come on Monday morning to verify my mesurements with wooden planks.

## 2023-12-13

Was preparing for test day.

Objectives:
- Test if people understand that this is a device that can recognize an object and then project it
- Test if people can understand each parameter without icons or text on the buttons
- Test if text descriptions are clear enough.

Made a new paper prototype that is close to the original size. Also prepared three sets of buttons ![buttons](/process/2023-12-13/IMG_5796.JPG)

After talking to Lauren added a new option of getting a projection of shading. Also, decided to get rid of the potentiometer and replace it with just a "random" button for unexpected interpretations of the object by AI. Played more with Midjourney. This is a racing snail ![racing-snail](/process/2023-12-13/dorotheusss_a_simplified_black_and_white_outline_of_a_snail_rac_dc59c538-2467-408b-8d91-724294f22c94.webp)

## 2023-12-12

Tested RFID reader again. ![RFID](/process/2023-12-12/IMG_5783.JPG) The maximum distance between it and an NFC tag is around 3cm, 1cm from each edge of the reader.

Did a soldering exercise. It was very difficult because my hand was shaking af, but at least it worked from the first time. ![soldering-1](/process/2023-12-12/IMG_5784.jpg) ![soldering-1](/process/2023-12-12/03c1d357-d76d-4465-8dca-043228cce181.JPG) ![soldering-1](/process/2023-12-12/7e2620ae-bac8-4cf7-9381-65aff336dbb4.JPG)

Current state of my 3D model. ![3D](/process/2023-12-12/Screenshot%202023-12-14%20at%2017.10.40.png) Struggling with adding the projector.

## 2023-12-11

Learnt how to use Fritzing. ![scheme](/process/2023-12-11/Screenshot%202023-12-11%20at%2011.50.50.png)

Turns out the reader did not work because I needed to secure connection by soldering a part to it. Pierre soldered it for me. To be tested again.

## 2023-12-09

Tried testing RFID reader. It kind of works if I connect all the cables directly, but this configuration is very unstable. Otherwise, I get an error.

## 2023-12-07

Need to think about the way I can cover power cables, because there will be one from the projector and one from the Raspberry Pi. Probably can put them in some textile with velcro.

Added necessary [steps](/process/2023-12-07/steps.md) for completing the project.

Talked to the guy from the Metal Pool. They have all sorts of steel tubes and plates, so basically it is up to me to decide on the size and thickness. Will need to finish my 3D model BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS, so that he can order necessary materials if needed. And straight after the holidays we will start production (Jan 8). The gravure of the text for my parameters can be made at the Prototype Pool.

His suggestion on how to do the base and fix the leg to it:
![suggestion_1](/process/2023-12-07/IMG_5736.JPG)
![suggestion_2](/process/2023-12-07/IMG_5737.JPG)
There will be a short large tube soldered to the base and the main tube will go inside and will be fixed with screws/bolts. The base is hollow, so that I can fit my electronics in it.


Need to think if I actually want to make a wooden prototype first. Probably only for some details. 

## 2023-12-06

Made first detailed sketch of my object. ![sketch](/process/2023-12-06/IMG_5729.JPG)

Since the projector is quite heavy (820g), the leg and the base should be metal, so that the object does not fall. The projector will be attached to the leg with three disks and a bolt. ![disks](/process/2023-12-06/IMG_5730.JPG) The shell of the head will be 3D printed, since it will allow to have a light top, probably with two parts. One part with holes for ventilation, because the projector heats up easily. Unfortunately, the object will have to be taller than I wanted (around 700mm), so that the projection is not too blurry. ![construction](/process/2023-12-06/IMG_5726.JPG)

Got a Raspberry Pi, SD card and cables from Pablo.

## 2023-12-05

Chose my electronic components:

- [RFID](https://www.distrelec.ch/fr/module-de-lecture-et-ecriture-rfid-compatible-arduino-13-56mhz-velleman-wpi405/p/30260977?trackQuery=rfid&pos=4&origPos=4&origPageSize=50&track=true&sid=e090ff711361566ede42bd989306aabde878056b&itemList=search) reader
- [NFC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/360) tags
- [Raspberry](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4292) Pi 4 Model B - 2 GB RAM 
- 3 soft [buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3101)
- potentiometer with a metal [knob](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2058)
- projector (ideally Pico projector because it is small and light, but for now I have [this](https://www.amazon.com/Projector-Magcubic-Keystone-Correction-Portable/dp/B0C84JLZ9K?th=1) )
- [camera](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5657) (in a perfect world)

## 2023-12-04

Talked to Pierre and Laure. For the simplicity, it makes sense to use an NFC reader instead of a camera for object detection, as well as predetermined objects with NFC tags. Otherwise, it is going to take ages to teach the AI to recognize random objects.

Tried to make a quick 3D sketch in Fusion ![3d_sketch](/process/2023-12-04/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.29.41.png) Kinda looks like a tomb stone..

Discussed possible shapes with Laure. Since, I am going to use NFC tags, I do not really need to make a box for putting objects. It can be just a flat surface. ![shape](/process/2023-12-04/231204_daria.jpg) In any case, the shape will be largely determined by my electronic components. Need to think about materials.

## 2023-12-01

Tried RGB LED light ![RGB_LED_1](/process/2023-12-01/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.07.20.png) ![RGB_LED_2](/process/2023-12-01/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.07.34.png) ![RGB_LED_3](/process/2023-12-01/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.07.48.png)

## 2023-11-30

Started learning Fusion. It is actually not that difficult, much easier than Blender and Cinema 4D. Made a pencil sharpener model ![sharpener_1](/process/2023-11-30/pencil_sharpener%20v4.png) ![sharpener_2](/process/2023-11-30/pencil_sharpener%20v4_2.png)

## 2023-11-29

More electronics. Learnt how to use PIEZO ![piezo](/process/2023-11-29/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.08.48.png)

Experimented with a light sensor ![light_sensor_1](/process/2023-11-29/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.08.17.png) ![light_sensor_2](/process/2023-11-29/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.08.28.png) and with a servo motor ![servo](/process/2023-11-29/Screenshot%202023-12-05%20at%2010.08.02.png)

## 2023-11-28

Now I know how to use a potentiometer and buttons. For buttons there is an internal resistor, that should be turned on via the code. This simplifies things. 

## 2023-11-27

Started learning electronics and how to use Arduino. Made SOS in Morse code with an LED.

## 2023-11-25

Added electronics scheme ![scheme](/electronics/scheme.JPG)

## 2023-11-16

Had mid [presentation](/presentations/HEAD-MD1_Caran-d-Ache_Daria-Kotova_Snailed-it.pdf) with Caran d'Ache.

Feeling awesome afterwards. On Monday morning I felt very frustrated and anxious, because I did not know if my idea made sense and was doable. But after several feedbacks on Monday, Wednesday and today, I feel quite reassured and somewhat relieved. I am also happy to finally understand what exactly I want to do. My project now has a mystery aspect, which I wanted to introduce but did not know how.

I sensed some excitement from Laure whenever she started asking if you can put my object on the table or on the floor or wherever. Do not know if Sophie liked it, she asked some clarifying question about the learning aspect, but I guess that is the topic that interests her in general.

Insights from this week: I need to plan wisely and the most important one is that I should ask for some feedback before judging myself (dah).

No idea how to start the electronics and how to improve my prototype but I will just trust the process and go with the flow. Peace.

## 2023-11-15

Finished slides for mid-presentation. Changed the name of the project to Snailed-it. Snailed-it because you nailed it :) but also because of the snail ![snail](/process/2023-11-15/camphoto_1804928587%202.JPG)

Also did some [user tests](/process/2023-11-15/user-tests/) for my last prototype, generated [Midjourney](/process/2023-11-15/midjourney/) illustrations to show the possible weirdness of AI's interpretations, as well as created various projection [outputs](/process/2023-11-15/output/).

## 2023-11-14

Today I made a new paper prototype based on Laure's feedback. It kinda looks like a phone-scuba-diving thiny. ![prototype](/process/2023-11-15/paper-prototypes-for-pres/IMG_5265.JPG)

## 2023-11-13

Cried a bit in the toilet. Am I even a designer? What a beginning to the week.

[Tested](/process/2023-11-13/user-tests/) Kick-starter. Apparently, having an assistant that you need to wake up is not obvious and very confusing. Abandonned this idea. Also, need to make it OBVIOUS that you need to put an object somewhere.

Had feedback from Laure, really helped and lifted up my spirit. Why does the assistant have to draw the outline for you if it can just project it. Genius. Can also have several options, like outline, decompose, magic (to add more stuff) and random (to randomize the output and add some spice). Feeling much better. Maybe I am a designer.

## 2023-11-12

**Pitch (what, who, where, and how), first version.**

Kick-starter is an assistant that helps people start drawing using the outlines of small objects around them. It is designed for people looking to occupy their free time. These people are open to drawing but do not know where or how to start. Kick-starter can be used at home, in the office or even at school. Simply place it on a sheet of paper and choose a small object to use as the basis for your future drawing. After analysing your object, Kick-starter draws its outline, which you can then use to kick-start your drawing.


**User journey**

![kick-starter-user-journey](/process/2023-11-12/kick-starter-user-journey.jpg)

**Key insights**
1. There is existential boredom, when people have suddenly a lot of free time and they are looking for ways to occupy themselves.
2. A lot of people do not mind drawing but they do not know what to draw and how to start.
3. Some people feel bored when they are alone. Drawing in a collaboration can be more fun.

**Next steps**





## 2023-11-11

Made a paper prototype of [Kick-starter](/process/2023-11-11/kick-starter) - an assistant that allows you to draw the outlines of small objects and thus start a drawing.

![kick-starter-1](/process/2023-11-11/kick-starter/IMG_5220.JPG)

## 2023-11-07

Prototype idea: the assistant detects if you put something on the paper, it then immediately rushes to the object and starts drawing around it. Drawing with negative space.

![negative_space_1](/process/2023-11-07/IMG_5207.jpg) ![negative_space_2](/process/2023-11-07/IMG_5208.jpg) 

## 2023-11-03

Why do I focus on textures? My assistant could help to draw whatever you want. You put something inside it, choose what outcome you want (complexity) and it scans the object and then draws it based on your settings. Thus it invites you to explore the world around you and helps you to overcome the initial creative block ("I do not mind drawing but I do not know what to draw and how").

![prototype_3](/process/2023-11-03/IMG_5205.jpg)

It can say: "Show me the world and I will show you how to draw it", "I want to learn more!.




## 2023-11-01

Continued doing [texture](/process/2023-11-01/textures-new-tests) and [sound](/process/2023-11-01/sound-tests) tests. Decided not to persue with [tastes](/process/2023-11-01/taste-tests) and sounds.

Made two prototypes: [texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand) ![texture-to-brush hand](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-brush-hand/IMG_5010.jpg) and [texture-to-image convertor](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-image-convertor).

![texture-to-image convertor](/process/2023-11-01/texture-to-image-convertor/IMG_5017.JPG)

Need to think on how to add the mystery/exploration aspect to the assistant.
